# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  A common problem in the modern day is figuring out what to watch and where you can watch it. There's too many streaming services for it to be a simple scroll and find situation. Our project is a movie finder based on streaming services. The user will use a search function to select which streaming services they have and options such as genre or rating. This works in two ways for the end user: first, they can search a specific movie and find out where it is streaming, and second, they can leave an open-ended search and receive results based on what their preferences are.
  
  The second key functionality is that the user has the option to log in and save items from their search to their own personal "to watch" list for future reference. This way they will not find themselves doing the same search over and over again to find a previous result. This can help eliminate the "What do we watch?" question by providing options they had previously saved. We seek to alleviate the annoyance of bouncing between services and various saved lists on those services, instead providing the user all their options in one site.

### Features
* Search:
User can enter a specific movie and/or select from options such as genre and rating. Search results will list movies falling into those criteria.

* User Login:
User can create an account and log in. They can manage their profile and save movies to their list once logged in.

* User "To Watch" List:
User can add and remove movies from their personal list. The list will display in a table with basic information about the movie, such as title, rating, streaming service, and genre.

### Technologies
* JavaScript
* REACT
* MySQL
* C#

### What I'll Have to Learn
We will need to do research on our selected API (TMDB) to confirm what data it provides and in what format. We will also need to learn REACT and figure out how we will be hosting our user list database.
